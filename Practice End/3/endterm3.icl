/* 8. FlexTree. 10 points
Flex Tree can have 4 types of nodes: Ternary, Binary, Unary and Terminal. As
names suggest these nodes have 3, 2, 1 and 0 children nodes repsectively.
Terminal nodes do not store any value, they indicate end of the tree.

Write a function that takes a FlexTree as an argument and converts
it to the list with following rules:
* TerminalNode should be converted to empty list.
* UnaryNode's child subtree should be converted to the list and this node's
value should be appended from front.
* BinaryNode's left and right children subtrees should be converted in order
and this node's value should be inserted after the left subtree values and
before the right subtree values.
* TernaryNode's left, mid and right children subtrees should be converted in
order and this node's value should be inserted after the left subtree values
and before the mid subtree values.

For example, if we have a FlexTree:
(TernaryNode 1)
/ | \
(BinaryNode 2) TerminalNode (UnaryNode 3)
/ \ |
TerminalNode (UnaryNode 4) (BinaryNode 5)
| / \
TerminalNode TerminalNode TerminalNode

After converting it to the list with these rules we get:
